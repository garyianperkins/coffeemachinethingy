# coffeemachinethingy
All the code and other files associated with the Coffee Machine Monitor project. A project primarily for learning different aspects of interfacing sensors through a micro-controller and Raspberry Pi and outputting status information via IRC, web-page and/or small display. May also involve facial recognition and high-power lasers!
